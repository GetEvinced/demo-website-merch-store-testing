# Demo E-Commerce Website

A React-based e-commerce demo website simulating a Google merchandise store. It features a homepage, a product listing page with filtering/sorting, product detail pages, a wishlist, a cart, and a multi-step checkout flow.

## Tech Stack

- **React 18** with functional components and hooks
- **React Router v7** for client-side routing
- **Webpack 5** as the bundler
- **CSS Modules** (for scoped component styles) alongside plain CSS files
- **Context API** for global cart and wishlist state
- No backend — all product data is static (`src/data/products.json`)

## URLs / Routes

| Path | Page | Description |

## Key Features

### Homepage (`/`)
Composed of several marketing sections: `HeroBanner`, `PopularSection`, `FeaturedPair`, `TrendingCollections`, and `TheDrop`. Clicking products navigates to their detail page.

### Products Page (`/shop/new`)
- **Filter sidebar** (`FilterSidebar`) — filter by price range, size, and brand using checkboxes. Active filters are shown as dismissible chips.
- **Sort dropdown** — sort by relevance, A–Z, price low-to-high, price high-to-low, or newest.
- **Product grid** — responsive grid of `ProductCard` components, each linking to the product detail page.

### Product Detail Page (`/product/:id`)
- Displays product image, name, price, brand, description, and available sizes.
- Quantity stepper (bounded by available stock).
- **Add to Cart** button — adds the selected quantity to the global cart.
- **Wishlist toggle** — heart button to add/remove the product from the wishlist.

### Cart (`CartModal`)
- Accessible from the cart icon in the `Header` at all times (hidden on `/checkout` and `/order-confirmation`).
- Supports updating item quantities and removing items.
- Displays a running total and a "Checkout" button that navigates to `/checkout`.

### Wishlist (`WishlistModal`)
- Accessible from the wishlist icon in the `Header`.
- Lists wishlisted products with a link to each product detail page and a remove button.

### Checkout (`/checkout`)
Two steps managed by local state:
1. **Basket** — review cart items, adjust quantities, see total.
2. **Shipping & Payment** — form with first name, last name, address, card number, and expiration date. All fields are required; inline validation is shown on submit.

On success, the cart is cleared and the user is redirected to `/order-confirmation` with a generated order ID.

### Order Confirmation (`/order-confirmation`)
Displays a success message, the generated order ID, and the customer's first name.
